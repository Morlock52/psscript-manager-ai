#Requires -Version 5.1

.SYNOPSIS
  Executes a given PowerShell script with parameters and timeout, capturing output.
.DESCRIPTION
  This script is designed to be called by the Node.js executor server.
  It takes the path to a user-provided script, optional parameters, and a timeout value.
  It executes the script, captures STDOUT and STDERR, handles timeouts, and exits with the script's exit code.
.PARAMETER ScriptPath
  The full path to the PowerShell script to execute.
.PARAMETER ScriptParameters
  A string containing the parameters to pass to the target script (e.g., "-Param1 'Value1' -Param2 123").
.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
  The maximum execution time in seconds before the script is terminated.
.NOTES
  This script should be executed with -ExecutionPolicy Bypass.
  It redirects STDERR to STDOUT for capture, but also writes errors to the host for logging.
